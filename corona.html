What you can expect to happen<span id="logo2"> if you're:

Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19
<br>
Contact tracing helps protect you, your family, and your community by:
<br>
•	Letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19.
<br>
•	Helping people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 get tested.
<br>
•	Asking people to self-isolate if they have COVID-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact.
<br>
During contact tracing, the health department staff </span>will not ask you for:
<br>
•	Money
<br>
•	Social Security number
<br>
•	Bank account information
<br>
•	Salary information
<br>
•	Credit card numbers
